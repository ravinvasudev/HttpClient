# HttpClient
Client to make HTTP requests.

HttpClient may be of interest to anyone building HTTP-aware client applications such as web browsers, web service clients.

Although, there are currently many HTTP Client API available on the Internet which are large and most of the time we actually do not utilize their full pros and end up consuming the simplest of the HTTP requests but my intention was to wrote this package came into existence when I had to consume REST APIs on a frequent basis. I thought of a library which encapsulates basic of calling REST API and provides simplest of the interface.

I am not up & against the POWERFUL. It's just the simplest of HttpClient :)

Note: I had developed this for my personal use but can be extended by anyone.
